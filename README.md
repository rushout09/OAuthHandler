# OAuthHandler Project

If you are building a production-grade application that interacts with other Platform's API (Ex: Twitter, Google, Shopify, Notion, etc)
you need a module that is:

1. Complex: Handles intricate OAuth2 flow to get end-user's permission to perform action on their behalf.
2. Fast and Secure: Safely stores and quickly retrieves Access tokens and Refresh tokens for end-users.
3. Scalable: Can be accessed by multiple instances across multiple regions. 

The OAuthHandler project implements above OAuth module as a microservice.
