# OAuthHandler Project

If you are building a production-grade application that interacts with other Platform's API (Ex: Twitter, Google, Shopify, Notion, etc)
you need a module that is:

1. Complex: Handles intricate OAuth2 flow to get end-user's permission to perform action on their behalf.
2. Fast and Secure: Safely stores and quickly retrieves Access tokens and Refresh tokens for end-users.
3. Scalable: Can be accessed by multiple instances across multiple regions. 

The OAuthHandler project implements above OAuth module as a microservice.


## Contribution

This project needs a lot of help from Open Source community.
We need help in writing documentation, testcases, and integrations for upcoming platforms.
This project is a good starting point for people getting started with open source programming.
